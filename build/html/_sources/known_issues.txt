Known Issues
===============

(2017-08-18) The AR pallet tracker is not working properly because the camera is not tracking the AR-tag so it gets out of the frame when just before it drives under the pallet. This causes the truck to try over and over again.

(2017-08-18) The model based pallet tracker starts even if we want to track a pallet with an AR-tag.
