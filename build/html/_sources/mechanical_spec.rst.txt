Mechanical Overview
-------------------

Do not operate MiniReach before reviewing the mechanical
information listed below.

Environmental
+++++++++++++

The MiniReach trucks are indoor laboratory
robots. Operating outside this type of environment could cause
damage to the MiniReach trucks, and injury or death to
operators.

Drive Surface
'''''''''''''
 - The drive surface of the robot must be capable of supporting the
   entire weight of MiniReach, about 180 kgs plus the weight of the
   payload. If the surface is too soft, MiniReach can get stuck and fail to drive.
   A commercial carpet, tile or cement floor is recommended.

 - MiniReach's ground clearence is only 1.5cm, so make sure the surface is
   flat enough.

Incline Surface
'''''''''''''''
 - MiniReach can be used with ramps, which are at no
   more than a [1/12?] slope. Ramps that are steeper than a [1/12?] slope
   are unsafe and may be a tipping hazard.

Water
'''''
 - MiniReach has not been tested for any type of contact with water
   or any other liquid. Under no circumstances should MiniReach
   come in contact with water from rain, mist, ground water (puddles)
   and any other liquid. Water contact can cause damage to the electrical
   circuitry and the mechanism.

Forces and Torques
++++++++++++++++++

Joint position, velocity, and force limits are implemented in the 
URDF file as well as in firmware. These joint limits control
the range of travel of the mechanism and the allowable velocity to prevent
over-travel.
