Known Issues
===============

(2017-08-18) The AR pallet tracker is not working properly because the camera is not tracking the AR-tag so it gets out of the frame when just before it drives under the pallet. This causes the truck to try over and over again.

(2017-08-18) The model based pallet tracker starts even if we want to track a pallet with an AR-tag.

(2017-08-18) Rarely an error can occur where connection cannot be made to IP "192.168.100.50". The issue haven't been investigated further but it is possibly a sensor that has the IP-address. A reboot will most often solve the problem.
