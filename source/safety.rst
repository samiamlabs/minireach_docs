Safety
======
Safety is extremely importatd to Toyota Material Handling. 
Safe operations of robots is important yet challenging and it is important to 
remember that safety is a continual process that
is shared by the robot designer, operator, and administrator. The following section 
provides a basic set of guidlines to support safety when using the MiniReach robot.

Safety Overview
---------------

When operating MiniReach robots users should always be conscious of safety. Remember the
robots are heavy pieves of equipment and have moving parts. As the robots travel through
an environment they can carry and manipulate a wide variety of objects. Since MiniReach 
robots are for application development, their moves and actions may not be entirely 
predictable. The MiniReach robots can cause significant damage if they fall or run into a 
person. There are also several ways that the robot can pinch fingers and other body parts.
MiniReach can also manipulate dangerous objects of knock over heavy objects. People should 
always be cautious and attentive around the MiniReach robots.

Design Features
---------------

There are several design features that makes the robot safer

 - Dead man's switch and parking break on the ps4 controller.
 - Emergency stop button.
 - Low-level fault detection on the robot.

These design features help make MiniReach more robust. However a R&D robot is **never**
absolutley safe. The application developers' safety, as well as the safety of others, 
depends on the developers' constant attention. It is important for the user to be aware 
of potential dangers and learn to anticipate and prevent problems.



General Usage Guidelines
------------------------

While many guidelines for safe use of a robot stem from common sense,
a basic set is listed below. It is important to follow these
guidelines, but please bote that these guidelines alone do not guarantee safety, only 
reduce risk.

* **Before operating** or working with a MiniReach each user must:

 - Read this user manual, spacifically the Safety section.


* **Supervise children, visitors**, and anyone who has not followed the previous guideline. In particular, make sure they: 

 - Do not come in range of MiniReach robots when active. 
 - Are aware that the robot could move unexpectedly and is potentially dangerous.
 - Are not alone with MiniReach.  
 - Do not operate MiniReach. 

* **Maintain a safe environment**. Safety is not only impacted by how a developer operates a robot, but the environment as well. The MiniReach R&D robots are designed to operate in laboratory environments.

 - Keep the robots **at least 5 meters from the top of a stairway or any other drop off**. 
 - Make sure the robots have adequate and level space for any expected or unexpected operation. 
 - If the MiniReach travels on a ramp, that slope of the ramp should not exceed ? (1:12). Also make sure that the robot cannot drive off the edge of the ramp. 
 - Make sure the environment is free of objects that could pose a risk if knocked, hit, or otherwise affected by the robots. 
 - Make sure that there are no ropes or cables that could get caught in the covers, wheels or fork. 
 - Make sure that no animals are near the robots.
 - Keep fingers, hair, and clothing away from wheels, gears, and any location that is could potentially be a pinch point. 
 - Be aware of the location of emergency exits and ensure that the robots cannot block them. 
 - Do not operate the robots outdoors. 
 - All testing of new features on the robots should be done in an enclosed area.

\

* Do not allow the robot to come in contact with liquids (spilled drink, rain, etc.) 

\
 
* Before removing any covers, the robot should be unplugged and the breaker switch should be off. 

\


* Use **common sense** when operating MiniReach R&D robots.

 - Do not allow the robots to hit any person.
 - Do not allow the robots to drive into contact with, or over, any body part. 
 - Do not allow the robot to interact with any sharp or dangerous items.

.. warning::
    Do not modify or remove any part of the software safety features
