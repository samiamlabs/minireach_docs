Charging
--------

The truck is charged by connecting a lab voltage supply set to 28.5V and limited to 10A.

.. warning::

  When the truck is not used for long periods of time the two black CAN bus connection
  protection caps shall be removed in order to disable the battery protection circuit.
  The protection circuit slowly draws power from the battery and it will eventually
  destroy the battery after a few weeks.

.. warning::

   When the lab supply is connected to the battery, there may be a spark even if
   the supply is turned off because of the output capacitor on the supply.
