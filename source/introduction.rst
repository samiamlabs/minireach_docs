This manual is intended to help users successfully install, use, and develop code on the miniature warehouse truck/robot refered to in this document as MiniReach. The software installed on the robot is based on ROS. Please visit http://ros.org to learn more about ROS.

All users should read and become familiar with the safe operating procedures set out in :doc:`Safety Section</safety>` before operating a robot.

* **Safe Envirenment**

 - Only operate MiniReach in an envirenment free of hazards.

* **Space**

 - Make sure that there is enough space for MiniReach to drive around and perform tasks.

   own router and can be connected to using wifi or one of the Ethernet ports on the 
   router.

   a lab voltage supply set to 28.5V with a 10A current limit.

* **ROS and MiniReach**

 - Familiarity with the Linux command-line is strongly recommended. The computers in 
   MiniReach have Ubuntu Linux installed. Tasks can be performed by logging in remotley
   by using ssh or other similar tool. Users can also directly plug in a display, mouse,
